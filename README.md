# Smart-Energy-Meter
Electrical appliances are all around us, starting from the indispensable 
charger of your smartphone to heavier appliances like room heaters, air 
conditioners, washing machines, and what not. While our monthly electricity 
bill gives us a vague idea of our culminating electricity consumption, it 
provides little to no detail about the current being consumed by particular 
devices. To determine the exact and instantaneous consumption of power we 
must have a way to detect the voltage and the current draw of our appliance.  
In this article, we will see how you can make a simple SMART ENERGY 
METER using an ESP32 and some commonly available sensors.
